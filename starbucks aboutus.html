<p style="position:relative;left:70px; right:70px; width:90%;text-align:justify;font-size:30px;font-weight:400;">Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. 
It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and 
spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic
tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.
Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become 
captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different
cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that 
Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the
warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for 
green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.</p>
<p style="position:relative;left:70px; right:70px; width:90%;text-align:justify;font-size:30px;font-weight:400;">Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington,
D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed
by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions 
of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all 
around the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: to inspire and 
nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:50px;font-weight:200;"> Coffee & Craft </h1>
<p style="position:relative;left:70px; right:70px; width:90%;text-align:justify;font-size:30px;font-weight:400;">It takes many hands to craft the perfect cup of coffee – from the farmers who tend to the 
red-ripe coffee cherries, to the master roasters who coax the best from every bean, and to the 
barista who serves it with care. We are committed to the highest standards of quality and service,
embracing our heritage while innovating to create new experiences to savor.</p>
